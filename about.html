<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Dilanka Kaushal Hewage, and I go by the hacker name `n3rdh4x0r`. I am a cybersecurity professional specializing in offensive security operations. My journey into cybersecurity began with childhood curiosity, coding, and diving into CTF (Capture The Flag) games and reverse engineering challenges. This passion continued through my university years, where I earned a BSc in Computer Science and participated in local and online CTF competitions alongside like-minded friends.</p> <p>After completing my BSc, I began my professional career as a Red Team Operator at the Sri Lankan Defence Ministry in 2016, where I further honed my skills. Later, I joined AIX Investment Group in Burj Khalifa, Dubai, where I continued to build on my offensive security expertise.</p> <p>Currently, I serve as a Senior Red Team Operator for the Dubai Government, playing a critical role in assessing and strengthening the cybersecurity defenses of our systems. Alongside my professional experience, I have continually expanded my knowledge, earning certifications such as OSCP, OSCE, CRTP, CRTE, CRTO, eCPPT, eCPTX, eWAPTX, and eCRE.</p> <p>In addition to my professional work, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and experience with the cybersecurity community through blog posts, workshops, and speaking engagements. I am dedicated to contributing to the advancement of the field. After completing my MSc in Cybersecurity, I am currently pursuing a PhD in the same field to deepen my expertise and make a meaningful impact in cybersecurity research.</p>
